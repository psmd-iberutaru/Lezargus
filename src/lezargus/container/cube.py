    Attributes
    ----------
    wavelength : Array
        The wavelength of the spectra. The unit of wavelength is typically
        in microns; but, check the `wavelength_unit` value.
    data : Array
        The flux of the spectra cube. The unit of the flux is typically
        in flam; but, check the `flux_unit` value.
    uncertainty : Array
        The uncertainty in the flux of the spectra. The unit of the uncertainty
        is the same as the flux value; per `uncertainty_unit`.

    wavelength_unit : Astropy Unit
        The unit of the wavelength array.
    flux_unit : Astropy Unit
        The unit of the flux array.
    uncertainty_unit : Astropy Unit
        The unit of the uncertainty array. This unit is the same as the flux
        unit.

    mask : Array
        A mask of the flux data, used to remove problematic areas. Where True,
        the values of the flux is considered mask.
    flags : Array
        Flags of the flux data. These flags store metadata about the flux.

    header : Header
        The header information, or metadata in general, about the data.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wavelength : Array
            The wavelength of the spectra.
        data : Array
            The flux of the spectra.
        uncertainty : Array, default = None
            The uncertainty of the spectra. By default, it is None and the
            uncertainty value is 0.
        wavelength_unit : Astropy-Unit like, default = None
            The wavelength unit of the spectra. It must be interpretable by
            the Astropy Units package. If None, the the unit is dimensionless.
        data_unit : Astropy-Unit like, default = None
            The data unit of the spectra. It must be interpretable by
            the Astropy Units package. If None, the the unit is dimensionless.
        mask : Array, default = None
            A mask which should be applied to the spectra, if needed.
        flags : Array, default = None
            A set of flags which describe specific points of data in the
            spectra.
        header : Header, default = None
            A set of header data describing the data. Note that when saving,
            this header is written to disk with minimal processing. We highly
            suggest writing of the metadata to conform to the FITS Header
